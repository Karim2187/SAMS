# Challenges To Do
(**ctd** for short)


**The highlight of this CTD is to try to write the solution as pythonic as possible, research how can you make your initial solution better.**

__this is an exercise to show how much can you learn python syntax on your own__ 

> be creative

## Challenges
---

### 1 - How big can you get 
Use loops and lists to get a list of numbers from the user and stop when the user enters a 'q',
then print the largest and smallest number in that list wherever it is

_example:_
```
insert number: 120
insert number: 3
insert number: 22
insert number: 13
insert number: 20
insert number: q
largest number is 120
smallest number is 3
```

### 2 - social butterfly
__you are developing code for a social network, you want to get a list of mutual friends between two people__

create 2 empty lists and let  user 1 enter names into the list, then when the user enters 'q' the program will ask user 2 for their friends names and when user 2 enters letter 'q' the program compares the 2 name lists and prints out the mutual names 

_example:_
```
user1: omar
user1: ismail
user1: osama
user1: karim
user1: q
user2: youssef
user2: mohamed
user2: osama
user2: aly
user2: omar
user2: som3a
user2: q
Mutual friends: [osama, omar]
```
