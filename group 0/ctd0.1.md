## Challenges

### 1 - Nerd alert
Take the total points of 6 courses from the user by getting the input 6 times and then calculate the average points for the semester for the student
_example:_
```
insert gpa: 78
insert gpa: 85
insert gpa: 78
insert gpa: 59
insert gpa: 80
insert gpa: 95
average: 79.16666667
```

### 2 - Is it cold in here
find out how to convert celsius to fahrenheit and vise versa to make a calculator that calculates it for the user
depending on what format he wants

_example:_
user input: temp=22
```
temp: 22
temp in fahrenheit is 71.6
```
