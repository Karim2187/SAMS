Software & Ai Management System

#### Workflow
each year new members get divided into groups based on skill level, every group has a group leader who is responsible for teaching the appropriate content for his group by giving outlined sessions and the necessary tasks, while testing them for work discipline during the first semester.
All groups should work in parallel depending on the workforce and the number of members in each group.

#### Groups
###### Group 0
skill levels vary between people with 0 experience and people who know what python is and maybe wrote a couple of lines but cannot formulate a fully functioning program
###### Group 1
people who tried python and know the syntax but need to employ the language in logically and syntactically challenging problems
###### Group 2
python savvy people with loads of syntax and problem solving experience but lack the deep knowledge of the python ecosystem and it's various packages
###### Group 3
image processing and devops experienced members
