## Challenges

### 1 - User Interface
You are supposed to implement a user interface for a login app that accepts a username and a password, then checks the existance of the username and it's password that should be hashed using md5 hashing algorithm.
the app should display a success or failure message upon pressing an enter button.
Don't forget to check user input for unacceptable strings like special characters.

_Hints:_
- understand what and why is password hashing required by watching videos on the topic, [preferebly this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q)
- you can use the hashlib library in python for hashing with md5 (search for it's usage online)
- use whatever GUI library in python you like (you can start by researching what is the best option out of Tkinter, PyQt5, Kivy)
- you can hard code the user info inside the code and store an extra guest account with username "guest" and password "SuperHardPassword99"

_example:_
