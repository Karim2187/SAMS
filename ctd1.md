# Challenges To Do
(**ctd** for short)



## Challenges
---
### 1 - Is it cold in here
find out how to convert celsius to fahrenheit and vise versa to make a calculator that calculates it for the user
depending on what format he wants
- check for wrong inputs by user (never trust the user)
- make it accept to modes:
    - mode 1 = celsius to fahrenheit
    - mode 2 = fahrenheit to celsius

_example:_
user input: mode=1, temp=22
```
mode : 1
temp: 22
temp in fahrenheit is 71.6
```

### 2 - How big can you get 
Use loops and lists to get a list of numbers from the user and stop when the user enters a 'q',
then print the largest and smallest number in that list wherever it is 
_example:_
```
insert number: 120
insert number: 3
insert number: 22
insert number: 13
insert number: 20
insert number: q
largest number is 120
smallest number is 3
```
